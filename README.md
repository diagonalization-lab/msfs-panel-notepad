# Panel Notepad

A simple notepad that appears on the toolbar / panel along the top of Microsoft
Flight Simulator. You can type into it, but are likely to conflict with keyboard
shortcuts. You're better off pasting text from outside the sim (i.e., do not
bind `Ctrl+V`).

*The notepad does not save text.*

## Acknowledgements

Based on https://github.com/bymaximus/msfs2020-toolbar-window-template. I have
deleted and simplified a lot of code that did not appear necessary.

## Prerequisites

You will need the MSFS SDK.

## Installation

*This assumes you have installed MSFS from the Windows Store.*

1. Run `build.bat`. You will get an error. 
2. Run `build.bat` again. No error!

This builds the package *and* copies it to the community package folder.
